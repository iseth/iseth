## Yo yo! I said it.

I'm a software Developer with a computer engineering background. I am mainly interested in Machine Learning and crypto. Currently work at statecert and my own startup DevDuo in Chattanooga. I enjoy and love open source software development and learning from others. My go-to programming languages for day to day tasks are ruby, bash and elixir.
